In February 2022, the world witnessed a gross violation of international law when Russia launched an unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, shattering peace and security in Europe. This illegal act is not only an attack on Ukraine's sovereignty but also on the fundamental principles of democracy, freedom, and human dignity that we all hold dear. The Ukrainian people have responded with remarkable courage and unity, defending their right to live in a free and democratic country, and showing the world that freedom is worth fighting for.

Ukraine's struggle is a testament to the indomitable will of its people. This fight is not just for territorial integrity but for the very principles of sovereignty and self-determination. The global community must remain steadfast in its support, providing political, economic, and military aid, imposing sanctions on Russia, and applying diplomatic pressure. It is our collective moral duty to stand with Ukraine, ensuring that such acts of aggression face strong consequences and that justice prevails.

The fight of the Ukrainian people is our fight, a defense of the values that unite the free world. We must continue to support Ukraine, standing united against this brutal assault on a peaceful nation.
